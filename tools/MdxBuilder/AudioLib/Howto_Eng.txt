Ò»¡¢How to setup the gernal audio library (To make TTS)
1. Build audio library (Use StarDict's WyabdcRealPeopleTTS.zip as exmaple)
a) Put all the .wav file into a directory. For example c:\WyabdcRealPeopleTTS
b) Put speexenc.exe, conv_sound.bat and *.dll into directory created in step a: c:\WyabdcRealPeopleTTS
c) create a directory named "spx" under c:\WyabdcRealPeopleTTS
d) run conv_sound.bat under c:\WyabdcRealPeopleTTS
all *.wav file will be converted into .spx format in "spx" directory, you can use speexdec.exe to try it.
e) Use MdxBuilder to create the sound.mdd
* Target: c:\sound.mdx
* Data: c:\WyabdcRealPeopleTTS\spx
* Encoding: UTF-16
* Check "Build Data archive only"
* Start

2. Put "sound.mdd" into your Device

PPC version:
3a) Assign the "sound.mdd" in the Option->Misc dialog of MDict.
4a) MDict will open the Sound.mdd when started. If there is match audio entry in the audio library, 
the speaker icon in MDict will be enabled.

Smartphone version:
3b) Assign the full path of "sound.mdd" in the Option dialog of MDict.
4b) MDict will open the Sound.mdd when started. If there is match audio entry in the audio library, 
the audio will be played automatically(You may turn off this in Option dialog). Or you may use '0' key
to listen to it again.

Known limitations:
1. The function of conv_sound.bat is not completed. Because when looking up audio entry, 
MDict will strip characters other then alphabic or digital¡£But conv_sound.bat can't strip filenames for you.
2. speexenc can't be runned under Vista.
